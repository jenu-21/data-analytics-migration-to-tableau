    DepTime FLOAT,
    CRSDepTime FLOAT,
    ArrTime FLOAT,
    CRSArrTime FLOAT,
    UniqueCarrier TEXT,
    FlightNum INTEGER,
    ActualElapsedTime FLOAT,
    CRSElapsedTime FLOAT,
    ArrDelay FLOAT,
    DepDelay FLOAT,
    Origin TEXT,

);
```

### How many total records does the table contain?

```
### output:

### Which country is the most popular destination for flights?

```sql
